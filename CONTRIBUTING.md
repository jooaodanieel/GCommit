## Disclaimer

As a project decision, I chose Python as programming language because is almost
sure to be already installed. With this in mind, try to use native Python
resources, so that there's no need to install anything else.
Yet, you're free to propose any change, even if it depends on other packages
to be installed -- sometimes it's worthy.
